## Sinopse
The [[Merchant Main Character Overall]] has to stealth through enemies to advance in to new zones.

## How it works
In the Dugeon there are stealth zones where [[Merchant Main Character Overall]] can hide in different places, while mobs patrol that area. Those zones have better [[Gathering Overall]]. Some zones may be necessary to be treversed to progress in game.

If the player gets caught stealthing, the enemy will rush knocking the player down, dropping the [[Merchant Backpack]], and teleporting the player to a respawn point. 
The player can set is respawn point in [[EnderChest dos Pobres]] and in artificial checkpoints.
