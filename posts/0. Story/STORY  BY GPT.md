There was once a goblin named Gizmo who lived in a world of fantasy and adventure. Gizmo wasn't the hero of the story, but he played a vital role in the grand scheme of things. You see, Gizmo was the merchant who sold items to the brave adventurers who set out to save the day. 
Gizmo had a magical backpack that could conjure up his shop from thin air. This came in handy when he followed the adventurers on their quests, setting up shop inside the biggest and most dangerous dungeons. His shop was filled to the brim with all sorts of magical trinkets and potions, as well as a wide selection of swords and armor. Gizmo prided himself on offering the best prices and the highest quality goods to his customers. But Gizmo didn't just rely on the adventurers to bring him supplies. He was a resourceful goblin, and he knew that the best materials could often be found within the dungeons themselves. So, while the heroes were busy fighting off monsters and completing their quests, Gizmo would sneak off on his own, gathering rare herbs, precious minerals, and other materials that he could use to craft his potions and weapons. He would sneak through the shadows, using all of his cunning and guile to avoid being noticed by the fearsome creatures that lurked within the dungeons. No matter what kind of hero walked through his door, Gizmo always had something to offer. He knew that the fate of the world rested on the shoulders of these brave adventurers, and he was more than happy to do his.
