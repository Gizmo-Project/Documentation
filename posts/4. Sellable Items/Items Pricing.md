# Base Evaluation
## The item price is "Base Standard Item Value" + "[[Party Needs ]]Value", meaning each item has its base value where it can never be sold for less.

## The player only has access to the Base Standard Price, only after selling the player as access to how much was the "[[Party Needs]] Value" (so that the knowladge of knowing whats is the item the party needs is applied)
